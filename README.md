<a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank">AT&T</a> is an American multinational telecommunications holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. It is the world's largest telecommunications company by revenue and the third largest provider of mobile telephone services in the U.S.

## Project

One of the main pain point that AT\&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.


## Our Goal

**To build a spam detector, that can automatically flag spams as they come based sollely on the sms' content.**
